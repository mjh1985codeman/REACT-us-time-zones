# REACT us-time-zones

Front End React Application that shows the major US time zones in addition to the users current local time and date.  I already built this application using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript but refactored it to use React and incorporated React's State and UseEffect hooks in order to make it better.  

The only resource I used for this application was the official react [documentation](https://reactjs.org/).  

## Tech Used:
