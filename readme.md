# React-Prac

Literally just a front end only react applicaiton that outlines the various uses of the react technology with comments throughout the code that explains what is happening in the code. 

This is intentended to be used as a learning tool and not for live production use.  

The only resource I used for this application was the official react [documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
